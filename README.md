# Syed Ibrahim Khalil's Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I am Ibrahim, a Computer Scientist specializing in Distributed and Mobile Systems with a passion for Privacy and Security, particularly Differential Privacy. I am a Certified Cybersecurity professional with expertise in IoT Security Engineering.
Welcome to my portfolio!

## About Me

I'm a versatile technologist who has worked with various stacks and technologies, but my current focus lies in cybersecurity and privacy tools. With a background in IT Infrastructure, I'm dedicated to enhancing digital security and safeguarding user privacy in today's interconnected world.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [JPMorgan Chase Financial Fraud Detection](https://github.com/SYEDIBRAHIMKHALIL/jpmc-financial-fraud-project): A data analysis project focused on detecting financial fraud using a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1), including scripts for transaction analysis, visualizations, and fraud identification.
- [CrowdAnym](https://github.com/SYEDIBRAHIMKHALIL/CrowdAnym): A cybersecurity project developed in collaboration between the [University of Bamberg](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/forschung/wissenschaftl-einrichtungen/forschungs-labs/smart-city-research-lab/translate-to-1-english-projektarchiv/translate-to-1-english-crowdanym/) and the [University of Washington](https://www.uwb.edu/news/2023/10/13/researching-security-and-privacy-for-smart-cities), focused on sensor vulnerability testing and penetration testing of wireless networks. Sponsored by [BMDV](https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/crowdanym.html), [Stadt Bamberg](https://smartcity.bamberg.de/2023/08/24/crowdanym-misst-via-sensoren-wie-voll-es-in-bamberg-ist/), and Safectory GmbH, it includes tools for generating spoofed MAC addresses, setting adapters to monitor mode, and executing attack scripts.
- [Cybersecurity Blog](link): A blog where I share insights, tips, and tutorials on cybersecurity, privacy, and emerging technologies.

## Research Contribution

I am actively engaged in research on privacy and security, with a focus on privacy-aware data collection and protection strategies. Recently, I contributed to a research project on privacy-aware crowd monitoring, which was presented at the [ACM SIGSPATIAL GeoPrivacy â€™23](https://sigspatial2023.sigspatial.org/). My role involved analyzing attack models that could exploit anonymized Wi-Fi probe data and developing technical data protection strategies to mitigate these risks.

You can read more about my research and findings in my blog post: [Privacy-aware Publication of Wi-Fi Sensor Data for Crowd Monitoring.](https://syedibrahimkhalil.com/2023/11/21/research-1/)
